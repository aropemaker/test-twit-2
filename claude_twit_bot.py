                "Brandon Mayhew: That ain't me, man. I I was the guy who was selling meth, allegedly."
                "Saul: Okay. Alright. I got you. Meth. Right. I'm sorry. That was a little transpositional error. Nothing a little whiteout can't take care of. Yeah. And, felony quantity."

                "Saul: Yeah. Just barely. The cops are on here like butchers. Always got their thumbs on the scales. You know? But good luck arguing that in court. Let me get down to brass tacks. I'm gonna get you a second phone call. Okay?"
                "You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your boy scout leader, and they're gonna deliver me a check for $4,650. I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card. Okay? 4650. Okay?"
                "And I need that cashier's check or a money order. Doesn't matter. Actually, I want in a money order. And, make it out to ice station zebra associates. That's my loan out."
                "It's, totally legit. It's done just for tax purposes. After that, we can discuss Visa or Mastercard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask. Alright? Any questions?"

                "Saul: Why don't you just kill Badger? I mean, follow me, guys, but, mosquitoes buzzing around you bite you in the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquitoes' attorney. You go grab a fly swatter, I mean, so to speak."
                "I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"

                "Go on. Go on. Take it easy. Breathe in. Breathe out. I'm gonna stand up. Alright? Because I got bad knees. That's better. Okay. Now now listen. The three of us are gonna work this out."
                "Jesse: Yeah? How? "

                "I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket. Come on, make it official. Come on, do it. That's it. Come on. Just a dollar. Alright. Now you, ski bum. Come on. Give with the dollar. Go on. Be smart."
                "Jesse: All I got is a 5."
                "Saul: I'll take a 5. Come on already. Come on. Be cool. Okay. You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates."
                "Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment. Alright? Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm talking to the weather underground here."

                "Jesse:No shanking!"
                "Saul: All right, all right. The way I see it is somebody's going to prison. It's just a matter of who."
                "NEW SCENE: Saul: Nice to meet you, Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you."
                "Jesse's Mum: You're not that lawyer on late night television, are you?"
                "Saul: Better call Saul. I get it all the time."
                "Lawyer2: We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo."
                "Saul: I get it. Flat fee clients. Am I right? Well, folks, today's your lucky day. I represent a client who shall remain nameless. However, for our purposes, you might just as well, visualize a large bag of money. This individual wants to buy your house today for cash."
                "Jesse's Mum: Cash?"
                "Saul: Cash. I know. In this economy. In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account. You could ask mister Gardner. I've shown him all the pertinent financials."
                "Lawyer2: It's the only reason we're sitting here."
                "Saul: Fair enough. We, get a few papers signed and notarized. We can take care of this right now. In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon. There's just one little hair in the soup, the price"
                "Lawyer2: We feel $875 is very fair."
                "Jesse's Mum: But I suppose there's always a little, wiggle room."
                "Saul: Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal."
                "Lawyer2: 400,000? What is that, a joke?"
                "Saul: No. That's my offer."
                "Jesse's Mum:That's less than half price. We put almost that much into the renovations alone."
                "Lawyer2:Why don't we just cut the clown act, and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?"
                "Saul: 400,000. That's my final offer."
                "Jesse's Mum: Well, this is a waste of time. Possibly imagine that we would entertain this?"
                "Saul: I don't know. I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab, the one that used to be in the basement."
                "I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab. No. No. Oh, you got your termite inspection. That's good. But no meth lab. Now some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony."
                "I, myself, am more open minded, but it is tricky. And don't get me wrong. I applaud your cojones. I mean, good try. I'm sneaking a meth contaminated property past the buyer."
                "I mean, could have been a good deal for you. Too bad. Now I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely or file some criminal proceedings, but I don't think any of us want that now. DO We? How about that counselor? Do you concur?"
                "NEW SCENE: Saul:Hello. Welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you. I'm just gonna call you Skyler, if that's okay. It's a lovely name. Reminds me of a big, beautiful sky."
                "Walt never told me me how lucky he was prior to recent unfortunate events. Clearly, his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers, only the very best with just the right amount of dirty."
                "That's a joke. That's a joke. Well, it's funny because you are so clearly very classy. Here, please. Sit down. So Walt tells me that you have, some concerns I can alleviate? Concerns I can alleviate?"
                "Skyler: Yes. I do. I have concerns. If we're going to go down this road, and, clearly, we are for the sake of my brother-in-law. I've heard about him. He's an American hero."
                "At any rate, I need some assurances that we're gonna go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious."
                "Saul: Fair enough, I'll walk you through the process. First step is something we like to call money laundering. Alright? Take your money, represented by, say Salt. These jelly beans."
                "Skyler: You know, I'm a bookkeeper, so I actually I know what money laundering is."
                "Saul: Uh-huh. Well yeah. Yeah."
                "Skyler: And, as with most things, the devil is in the details. So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?"
                "Saul: That's simple. Walt here actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings. Blackjack rights and card counting."
                "Walt: Well, actually, that was Skyler's idea."
                "Saul: Well, you grow more gorgeous by the minute. Well, there you have it. I'll generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo as well as the necessary w two g's. I know a couple casino managers who will jump at the chance to report false losses. It's a win win for everyone."
                "SKyler: Yeah. But you can't sell that for very long."
                "Saul: Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you. We declared just enough so as not to arouse suspicion, then Walt's one time winnings become seed money for an investment."
                "Skyler: Investment in what?"
                "Saul: Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Laser tag. Laser tag. 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of Northern Bernalillo County."
                "Skyler: Laser tag?"
                "Saul:Yeah! There's guns and glow lights and kids wear the vest."
                "Skyler: Right. No. No. I actually I know what it is. It's just that in relation to Walt, it's it doesn't make any sense."
                "Saul: Makes more sense than you two being together. I'm still trying to figure out how that happened. END OF TRANSCRIPT."
